I was planning my life out & chanced upon a DevOps role at Tencent. My previous internship at Home Affairs left me wanting to learn more about the cloud & CI/CD too, so I applied!

After 3 rounds of interviews I was fortunate enough to join [Tencent’s Interactive Entertainment Group (IEG)](https://ieg.tencent.com/). My day-to-day would have been to support operations of well-known games like [PUBG Mobile](https://www.pubgmlite.com/en-US/), [Pokémon Unite](https://unite.pokemon.com/en-us/) and [Honor of Kings](https://www.honorofkings.com/global-en/) but we figured I would be a better fit as ML/LLMOps due to my prior ML experience.

Engineers often have to account for crashes & anomalies in game servers to the managers, & the review of these reports are often manual & unnecessarily taxing.

I wrote pipelines to reduce toil for my manager in reviewing business reports. Downstream tasks include translation since we had colleagues who speak different languages from different parts of the world, and also summarisation to make reports succinct and easy to read.

This reduced time taken for reviews by approximately ~40%, which meant more time for managers to focus on other priorities.

Overall, it was enriching to work independently & collaborate globally, and definitely heartening to see machine learning solutions implemented at scale.
